## Summary 

After watching this lesson on Github Profile optimizing, I realized I need to shift my long formed habit of handwriting and/or typing my notes and just keeping them locally. I have 10's of thousands of pages worth of handwritten notes, in notebooks, binders, and printed notes. 

When in hinsight it's ideal to type my notes in a code editor, using markdown and pushing them to Github as often as possible. 

In learning mode, I found myself hesitant in my ability to start contributing to open sourced projects. But, now I know the tips provided in this lesson. 

From now on my goal is commit daily and start contributing to open source projects.
